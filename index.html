<h3>
	Medicine
</h3>
<p>
	Currently, I am in my second year of medical school. I must say that I'm loving it although it is a pain from time to time - especially before exams start. So far I haven't spent much time in the hospital. That will only come next year! Since starting my course, I have learnt an immense amount of information about the human body and some practical skills.

<h3>
	OpenMinds
</h3>
<p>
	In my free time, I volunteer at a organisation called OpenMinds. As part of this initiative, we go to local schools and teach the pupils about mnetal health issues, including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse.

<h3>
	Coding
</h3>
<p>
	I tried learning how to code for the first time last summer but I completely failed. My second try was in February when I attended a coding course organised by my unversity and I finally learnt basics of Python. At the moment I'm continuing at the Code First: Girls' Summer Intensive Course.
